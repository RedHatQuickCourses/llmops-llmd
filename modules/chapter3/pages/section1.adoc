= LLM-D Benefits

[TIP.moneybag]
.Performance, Performance, Performance!
====
At the end of the day, it's all about results. LLM-D delivers tangible gains that you can show to your boss.
====

Here's a taste of what public benchmarks have shown:

* **3x LOWER** ðŸ“‰ average Time-To-First-Token (TTFT). Users perceive your app as being 3x faster!
* **2x HIGHER** ðŸ“ˆ queries-per-second (QPS). Serve double the users with the same hardware!
* **Massive TCO Reduction** ðŸ’¸. Achieve more with less. Stop buying more GPUs and start using the ones you have more efficiently.


****
ðŸ¤” **"But why should I care?"**

Simple. LLMs are *expensive*. Every wasted GPU cycle is money down the drain. LLM-D is designed to plug those leaks, letting you serve more users, faster, and for a fraction of the cost. It's not just about tech; it's about making your AI projects economically viable.
