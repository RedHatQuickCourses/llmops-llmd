This course is a multi-format learning journey. You will find a mix of videos, technical articles, and resource links, but the core of this course is delivered through Interactive Arcades.

What is an "Arcade"?
An Arcade is an interactive demonstration. You'll read the content on each slide and then click on "hotspots" (like blinking dots or text boxes) to move through the presentation. This format is used for both conceptual guides and some lab exercises.

Pro-Tips for the Best Experience
Here are a few tips to get you started:

Go Full Screen: This is the highly recommended way to use Arcades. Use the "expand" icon (usually in the top-right corner) to ensure hotspots and text don't overlap.

Navigate: Use the arrows in the top-left corner to move forward and back through the presentation.

Track Your Progress: The bar at the bottom of the window shows your progression through the interactive segments.

If you're new to Arcades and would like a visual walkthrough, you can find a helpful video in the appendix.
