*The Master Conductor*

Think of **Kubernetes** as the conductor of an orchestra. It makes sure all the musicians (pods) are in their seats and have their instruments. **LLM-D** is the special guest conductor who knows the symphony (your AI workload) inside and out, telling each musician exactly when and how to play for a perfect performance.
